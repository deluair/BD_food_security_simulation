    """Analyze and visualize food security simulation results"""
    def generate_food_security_metrics(self):
        # Calculate food security indicators for Bangladesh
        
    def analyze_system_resilience(self):
        # Assess food system resilience under different scenarios
```

Create dashboards for Bangladesh food security management:
- Food availability mapping by region and season
- Price monitoring and volatility early warning
- Nutritional status tracking by demographic group
- Climate risk and adaptation option visualization
- Technology adoption pattern mapping
- Dietary diversity and food consumption visualization
- Supply chain bottleneck identification
- Production forecasting and food balance projection
- Import dependency and self-sufficiency assessment
- Vulnerability hotspot mapping and targeting
- Policy effectiveness evaluation metrics
- Resource use efficiency and sustainability indicators

## Advanced Considerations

1. **Delta Environment Adaptation**: Special focus on Bangladesh's unique active delta environment and food production adaptation

2. **Population Density Pressure**: Incorporate one of the world's highest population densities on food system sustainability

3. **Religious and Cultural Dimensions**: Model food consumption practices influenced by Bengali and Islamic traditions

4. **Seasonal Vulnerability Patterns**: Capture the pronounced seasonal hunger patterns unique to Bangladesh

5. **Rural-Urban Transformation**: Detail the rapid urbanization impacts on food systems and dietary patterns

6. **Smallholder Dominance**: Focus on the predominance of small and marginal farmers in the agricultural system

7. **Aquatic Food Importance**: Highlight the critical role of fish and aquatic foods in Bangladesh diets

8. **Disaster Recovery Cycles**: Model the frequent disaster-recovery cycle impacts on food system resilience

9. **Remittance Economy Influence**: Include the substantial impact of overseas remittances on food security

10. **Gender Dynamics in Food Systems**: Capture the critical role of women in Bangladesh's food production and nutrition outcomes

## Implementation Notes

The simulation should enable Bangladesh food security managers to:
- Evaluate climate adaptation strategies for food system resilience
- Optimize safety net program targeting and effectiveness
- Assess dietary diversification pathways for nutrition improvement
- Design sustainable intensification approaches for productivity enhancement
- Plan import strategy optimization for price stability
- Develop export potential for agricultural growth
- Prioritize infrastructure investment for supply chain efficiency
- Design policy coherence improvements across food system dimensions
- Target technology dissemination for maximum adoption
- Evaluate food safety system strengthening approaches

Leverage technologies including:
- Pandas/NumPy for Bangladesh food security data processing
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for yield prediction and consumption pattern modeling
- GeoPandas/QGIS for spatial food security mapping
- NetworkX for value chain and institutional network modeling
- Scikit-learn for food security outcome prediction
- Prophet/ARIMA for seasonal price and production forecasting
- MESA for agent-based modeling of farmer decision-making
- Dash/Plotly for interactive food security dashboards

This comprehensive framework will provide sophisticated projections of Bangladesh's food security system dynamics, capturing both challenges and opportunities for one of the world's most populous and climate-vulnerable nations, focusing on the critical 2025-2035 period of development and adaptation.
